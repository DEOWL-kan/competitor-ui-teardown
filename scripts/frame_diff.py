"""Measure the actual rhythm of an animated screen from a screen recording.

Eyeballing a few sampled frames gives you the wrong answer — you will read a
2.7s ease-in-out crossfade as "changes every 2.5s with a 0.6s fade". This
computes per-frame difference over a region of interest and reports where
motion actually starts, peaks and stops.

Shape of the curve matters as much as the timing:
  - bell curve (slow -> fast -> slow)  = eased crossfade or eased camera move
  - plateau                            = linear transition
  - spike                              = hard cut
  - low but never zero                 = continuous motion (Ken Burns, video)
  - dead flat at zero                  = genuinely static

Requires ffmpeg/ffprobe. stdlib-only otherwise.
